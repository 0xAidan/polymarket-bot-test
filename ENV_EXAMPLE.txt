# ============================================================
# Signature Type - IMPORTANT! Must match how you created your Polymarket account
# ============================================================
# 0 = EOA wallet (pure EOA, no proxy wallet - rare, only if you NEVER see a proxy address)
# 1 = Magic Link / Email signup (you signed up via email, Polymarket created internal key)
# 2 = Browser Wallet + Proxy (you connected MetaMask/Rabby AND Polymarket shows a "Proxy Wallet")
#
# HOW TO KNOW WHICH TO USE:
# 1. Go to polymarket.com/settings
# 2. Look for "Proxy Wallet" address
# 3. If you see a proxy address different from your MetaMask → Use type 2
# 4. If you signed up via email/Magic Link → Use type 1
# 5. If no proxy wallet exists (rare) → Use type 0
#
# If you're getting "invalid signature" errors, you likely have the wrong type!
POLYMARKET_SIGNATURE_TYPE=0

# Funder/Proxy Wallet Address - IMPORTANT FOR BALANCE DISPLAY!
# This is where Polymarket holds your USDC. To find it:
# 1. Go to polymarket.com/settings
# 2. Look for "Proxy Wallet" or "Trading Wallet" address
# 3. Copy that address here
# 
# If you see $0 balance in the dashboard but have funds on Polymarket,
# you likely need to set this to your proxy wallet address.
# 
# You can also find it by going to polygonscan.com with your EOA address
# and looking for token transfers to your Polymarket account.
