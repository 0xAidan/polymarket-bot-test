# IMPORTANT: Use direct URLs with Builder credentials - proxies don't help!
# Builder credentials (above) authenticate your requests to bypass Cloudflare blocking.
# DO NOT use a Cloudflare Worker proxy - it won't work because Polymarket's 
# Cloudflare still blocks requests from Workers. Just use the direct URLs below.

# ============================================================
# Signature Type - IMPORTANT! Must match how you created your Polymarket account
# ============================================================
# 0 = EOA wallet (pure EOA, no proxy wallet - rare, only if you NEVER see a proxy address)
# 1 = Magic Link / Email signup (you signed up via email, Polymarket created internal key)
# 2 = Browser Wallet + Proxy (you connected MetaMask/Rabby AND Polymarket shows a "Proxy Wallet")
#
# HOW TO KNOW WHICH TO USE:
# 1. Go to polymarket.com/settings
# 2. Look for "Proxy Wallet" address
# 3. If you see a proxy address different from your MetaMask → Use type 2
# 4. If you signed up via email/Magic Link → Use type 1
# 5. If no proxy wallet exists (rare) → Use type 0
#
# If you're getting "invalid signature" errors, you likely have the wrong type!
POLYMARKET_SIGNATURE_TYPE=0

# Funder Address - Usually leave blank (defaults to your wallet address)
# Only set this if you're using a proxy wallet (signature type 1)
# and the funder is different from your EOA wallet
